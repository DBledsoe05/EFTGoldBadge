# EFTGoldBadge
Ok so I started my cafe project with the Komodo Insurence Company in mind and did that way. Also the claims insurence to me that way of solution was the most comfortable way to approach these projects.
Setting up the Pocos weren't to hard and the repos. The UIs of all the projects was giving me the most trouble.
Badge program was definetly the hardest one out of the bunch I went with a different way of doing thanks to Terry help.
It was definetly a lot for me to handle, but i think I did a decent job.
Oh also on the claims project me a bit of time to figure out how to use dateTime in the code for the ui lots of research to get three lines of code done. ugh...
I'm hoping I was able to accomplish the goals asked of me and hoping to move forward to learning more code.
